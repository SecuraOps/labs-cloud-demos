# Configure locks

In the left navigation panel, the subscription lock feature's name is **Resource locks**, while the resource group lock feature's name is **Locks**.

> **Note**
>> You can't add a lock to management groups.

1. In the Settings blade for the resource, resource group, or subscription that you wish to lock, select Locks.
2. To add a lock, select Add. If you want to create a lock at a parent level, select the parent. The currently selected resource inherits the lock from the parent. For example, you could lock the resource group to apply a lock to all its resources.
3. Give the lock a name and lock level (Delete, ...). Optionally, you can add notes that describe the lock.
4. To delete the lock, select the Delete button.
